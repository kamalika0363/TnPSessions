# Object Oreinted Programming

## Funtions

> Code written away from the script when needed, called from the script when needed, when called control gets transferred, code gets executed and controls comes back to the user.

1. reuse
2. modular programming
3. faster development

- python primitive are passed by value
  - changes are only seen in function
  - if we need to see RND
- python data structures are passed by ref
  - changes are seen globally
  - if changes are at several places
- functions are overloaded and hence polymorphic in nature w.r.t datatype

- return
  - return control back to script
  - return in python can pass 1 as well as n data
  - 1 data mainatains primitivr type
  - n data uses tuple

## Recursion

> keep recursion as last option

1. code runs slower
2. takes more memory
3. complex to understand
4. is short and smaller to write

- key value parameters
  - one can give data in any order but as key value pair

- variable size parameter
  - one can take n elements
  - defined by *`<var>`
